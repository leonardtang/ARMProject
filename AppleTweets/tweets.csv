gogigupta,2019-02-04,23:32:59,And I‚Äôm swayed by your argument that Apple cares about consumers in its DNA.
gogigupta,2019-02-04,23:30:24,I think that the fixed fee on subscription services is too much.  Is the Netflix app different when you could pay/manage your subscription through Apple vs the model going forward?  Did Apple really need 30%15% of that?  30% of $2.99 - fine.  30% of $180/1st year and 15%/ongoing?
waltmossberg,2019-02-04,23:26:50,"4/ But, as I noted before, this is really just chapter 10,000 in the decades-long battle by techie-oriented folks to put their interests ahead of those of average consumers, as they did in the old days. And Apple is their favorite target because it markets to non-techies."
waltmossberg,2019-02-04,23:24:31,"3/ It wouldn‚Äôt matter to me in the least if Apple cut its percentage to, say, 15% across the board, as long as its curation remained unchanged."
waltmossberg,2019-02-04,23:19:08,"2/ But, on Android, where alternate stores do exist in large parts of the world, I‚Äôm unaware that anyone adheres to these principles as well as Apple does. Please let me know if you discover one."
waltmossberg,2019-02-04,23:17:20,1/ No mobile platform company today cares remotely as much about privacy and the consumer‚Äôs interests (as opposed to advertisers or vendors) as Apple. It‚Äôs certainly possible that an unknown company could care more or do it better.
waltmossberg,2019-02-04,23:12:52,"I can only assume you don‚Äôt recall the pre-iPhone era. It had nothing to do with VCast. ANY third-party developer desiring to offer ANY app on ANY phone had to pay nearly all of its revenues to the carriers. Apple radically changed that, creating the market in smartphone apps."
gogigupta,2019-02-04,23:11:24,"Is the argument being made that no company can better review an app than Apple?  What about a store that requires multiple reviewers from a list of known companies?  Apple does an admirable job in app reviews, but Jobs wouldn‚Äôt have liked In App Purchases being the de facto model"

waltmossberg,2019-02-04,22:08:32,"It isn't a possibility of more malware. It's a certainty of more malware and worse things, like cyber weapons wielded by foreign powers. A certainty. By contrast, your prediction of lower prices on apps is just a possibility, since most apps are free or cost trivial amounts."
stevesi,2019-02-04,21:40:06,I used to try that argument with CompUSA but it didn't work. Turned out my idea of how much something is worth wasn't really relevant :-)
waltmossberg,2019-02-04,21:10:01,I too wish other platforms like webOS and Windows Phone had succeeded. But they didn‚Äôt. And making the internet accessible and safe for consumers matters vastly more to me than making it an easier place for techies to operate. That‚Äôs the heart of most of these debates.
anthologist,2019-02-04,21:05:03,*Leslye. Damn @apple butterfly  keyboard that  still isn't fixed!
waltmossberg,2019-02-04,21:04:43,"I disagree. The internet has become a hotbed of crime, privacy theft and even cyber warfare. Apple isn‚Äôt perfect, but it tries to block these things. Fracturing of the app distribution system in the absence of any overriding problem that might justify it seems reckless."
mrleonardkim,2019-02-04,21:00:34,"Yay I love @apple ‚ù§Ô∏è they replaced the keyboard üòäüòäüòä thanks @tim_cook, both Chris the store manager and Alec at the Glendale Galleria were great! They were quick, kind, courteous, thoughtful and went the extra mile!"
waltmossberg,2019-02-04,20:43:31,"Depends on the Supreme Court‚Äôs application of our archaic antitrust laws. But I‚Äôll tell you that I‚Äôd never buy an app from any alternate store with lower standards than Apple‚Äòs, regardless of price. The oligopoly is a big problem. But scamming and malware are just as bad."

johanneslenz,2019-02-04,19:08:34,Less in price and whats about quality of apps? Whats about high standards of iOS in comparison?
stevesi,2019-02-04,19:07:08,"Subscriptions are a new offering. Like everyone doing them I suspect everyone ends up with more money except the buyer, regardless of the percentage :-)"
waltmossberg,2019-02-04,19:06:41,"You mean, just randomly, or because the market for quality or original apps has shrunk? Should the government mandate a lower price, because I‚Äôm a huge proponent of tech regulation, but even I don‚Äôt support price controls. There is a court case on this, though - as you know."
backlon,2019-02-04,19:01:04,but I agree 30% was a big step forward! I just think we could take another step
backlon,2019-02-04,18:56:26,"Lots of things are better now than they were before the iPhone, so comparing 30% to what existed before only goes so far in my mind.   Even Apple recognizes it‚Äôs a lot, is offering better rates on subscriptions after a year."
waltmossberg,2019-02-04,18:53:32,"Echoing @stevesi, I‚Äôd note that when Steve Jobs announced @Apple would take only 30%, the room of developers erupted in applause. I was there. Why? Because getting your app on the deck in a phone before that required giving the carriers *most* of the revenue, often 70% or more."

stevesi,2019-02-01,02:37:05,Such a platform is neither good for developers looking to fully ‚Äúutilize‚Äù the platform nor would be good for consumers looking to a secure platform.   Platforms must be successful multi sided/ecosystems or be extremely good at one side.
stevesi,2019-02-01,01:17:45,Good example.
getwired,2019-02-01,01:15:59,"Internet Explorer had a model that wasn‚Äôt centralized in this explicit of a manner, but Microsoft was still the arbiter... through ActiveX killbits."
ianbetteridge,2019-02-01,01:12:26,"Also: A single gatekeeper is, at the very least, easy to regulate than millions of individual devs. Look at GDPR for an example, where companies have wildly different interpretations on compliant behaviour. Think how MS‚Äô behaviour was curbed by its consent decree... :)"
stevesi,2019-02-01,01:08:31,"It is more about defining what the rule set is for software -- is that a static set of rules, which would just be the APIs but there is no way to avoid the use of APIs in ways not intended (I had 25 tweets on that yesterday). So then you need an enforcement system. Or air gap."
ianbetteridge,2019-02-01,01:08:16,Whoever builds and maintains that model must have the ability to either auto-deploy to patch privacy holes (otherwise it‚Äôs inherently insecure) or revoke the ability of malicious code to run. Neither is something that would fit your ideal.
ianbetteridge,2019-02-01,01:06:36,"What you‚Äôre asking for is a chimaera: a decentralised privacy (not the same as security) model with all the advantages of having a gatekeeper. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs technically possible, partly because someone has to (at least) build and maintain the software."
stevesi,2019-02-01,00:52:02,Perhaps like when we use ATM/credit cards. They retain the right for whatever reason to stop them from working at any time--and there isn't a card alternative that does not provide that centralized security.
stevesi,2019-02-01,00:50:12,"Nilay is right to a large degree. You can turn off your browser, defender and Windows Update and then you run in isolation. BUT it is also the case that an app can stop working any time the system is updated, at the discretion of the platform (or by accident)."
reckless,2019-02-01,00:43:44,"All of this only happens if you to accept centralized security models, which no desktop platform forces you to do in order to run apps. We made a startling set of tradeoffs around security starting with mobile and they are worth constant scrutiny"
stevesi,2019-02-01,00:26:47,It is common for some to look at competing products and describe a product with the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù attributes of both that they desire (CEOs do this all the time during development). The market doesn‚Äôt create those for many reasons. Just like context X with no ads isn‚Äôt an option.
stevesi,2019-02-01,00:24:06,This is totally true. Take for example Chrome revoking a Cert as well as an example.

What IS Apple's next move that's so interesting?"
daniel_rubino,2019-01-02,19:04:03,"That's a pretty bad hot take, sorry. The bigger picture is smartphone sales are flat and Apple's choices are made worse by a stagnant market.  Apple's services pale compared to Amazon, Microsoft and others. And wearables - so far - is not doing much for them at all."
anshelsag,2019-01-02,19:02:40,"Yes, but we've had a flat smartphone market for a while now. I believe Apple's problem is one that they are having a hard time justifying the premium pricing of a product that has less expensive or equally expensive competitors with more premium features."
